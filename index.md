## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

  This was my third favorite lab because even though it was such a simple task for the lab, it was my first exposure to github,
  vs code and how to use the terminal. Throughout the semester it took repetition to remember all thebasic commands but its
  slowly started to become second nature on how to use said programs and how to check for improvements along with testing and
  commiting and pushing.

* Lab 7

  This was my second favorite lab because we were afforded the opportunity to use military time which seemed uncommon among
  my classmates in lab, I just so happen to have almost a decade of experience using militarytime for my past career. Along
  with the uncommonality of how to tell time we got the chance to write a program for the common parking signs that are
  confusing at times. In this code we finally got to incorporate stoi along with else if statements. I heard that the use
  of && and || confused plenty of students because it almost seemed as if you had to use them in a manner that seems
  opposite of the english language.

* Lab 11 Part 2

  This was my favorite lab because the concept behind the coding at a basic level dips into the gaming realm and learning about
  constructors, getters and 2D vectors was a fun challenge. With all the practice from the previous labs my partner and I seemed
  to just be flowing through the work which was nice.
